 * concurrencyMemcpyKernelMapped.cu
 *
 * Microbenchmark to shmoo the speedup from concurrent kernels when
 * operating on mapped pinned memory.
 *
 * NOTE: To date, I have not found a piece of hardware where this is faster.
 *
 * Build with: nvcc -I ../chLib <options> concurrencyMemcpyKernelMapped.cu
 * Requires: SM 1.1 for mapped pinned memory and global atomics.
